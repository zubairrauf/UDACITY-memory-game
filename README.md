## Instructions
The game consists of 16 cards. You can click on a card to open it and then click on another card to match with the first one. If the cards match, they will stay open and
you can proceed with opening other cards. If the cards don't match, they will close again. Try to remember which symbols the cards have and match all the cards in as few clicks
as possible.

## Stars
You have three stars when you start the game. If you complete the game in 26 or fewer clicks, you get the three star rating.
If the total number of clicks is between 27 and 36, you will get two stars. For more than 36 clicks, you will get one star.
